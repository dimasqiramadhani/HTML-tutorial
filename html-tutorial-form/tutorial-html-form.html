            The form attribute

            1. action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

            2. target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. the target attribute can have one of the following values. 
                1. _blank    : the response is displayed in a new window or tab.
                2. _self     : the response is displayed in the current window.
                3. _parent   : the response is displayed in the parent frame.
                4. _top      : the response is displayed in the full body of the 
                               window.
                5. framename : the response is displayed in a named iframe.
            
            3. method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data. the form data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP posst transaction (with method="post").

            Note on get:
                1. Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs.
                2. Never use get to send sensitive data (the submitted value 
                   will be displayed in query url parameters).
                3. The length parameters is limited (2048 characters).
                4. Get is good for non-secure data, like query strings in google.
            
            Note on post:
                1. appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request 
                   (will not shown in the URL).
                2. post has no size limitation, and can be used to send large 
                   amounts of data.
                3. Form submissions with post cannot be bookmarked.
